Just my notes on what the data inside a soul doll is (don't mean to make it complete complete, someone can do it :P)
testing it on a talisdam
-----------
Sprite (24 width, 32 height) (different value seems to represents different tile)
0 - 0F
responsible for the top 24*5 pixel row of a frame
10 - 1F
the next 6 pixel row
...utill
2FF
There are 32 pixel is each sprite. Each sprite is seperated into 6 rows.
1st row, 5 pixel in height
2nd, 6
3rd, 5
4th, 5
5th, 5
6th, 6

How the Talisdam recognize what the soul doll is. HOWEVER, it only (seems to) change the looks up sprite  , but it (seems to) only changes the looks up look of the legendz
